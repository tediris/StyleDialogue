but as Tarzan of the Apes sat one day in the cabin of his father delving into the mysteries of a new book the ancient security of his jungle was broken forever
it wasn t the Snitch at all
never heard of a Wizard s duel before I suppose of course he has said Ron wheeling around
you who have never known your family see them standing around you
he d lived with the Dursleys almost ten years ten miserable years as long as he could remember ever since he d been a baby and his parents had died in that car crash
I wonder where Jonathan is and if he is thinking of me
Tarzan took the envelope and tore it open
half terrified half furious they acted as though any chair with Harry in it were empty
the carriage ordered from the hotel was waiting
what do you mean
the sled swayed and trembled half started forward
for a moment he stood without listening intently
he was sounding the deeps of his nature and of the parts of his nature that were deeper than he going back into the womb of time
Jane is a most obedient daughter
wait cried Professor Porter as Tarzan was about to follow
somehow although the reality seems greater each time the pain and the fear seem less
do you forget he said with actually a smile that last night he banqueted heavily and will sleep late
on the cart was a great square chest
we seem to be drifting to some terrible doom
I reminded her that a doctor s confidence was sacred but that you were grievously anxious about her
Professor m McGonagall Harry had forgotten they still had detentions to do in the furor over the points they d lost
he backed away as quietly as he could
at the first step upon the cold surface Buck s feet sank into a white mushy something very like mud
the effect on Lucy was not bad for the faint seemed to merge subtly into the narcotic sleep
another lesson
how does it work
for an instant or two we paused at the door to listen but there was no sound that we could hear
the earth children were not noticed being so near the average size of the Mangaboos and the horse had remained in the house of the Sorcerer with Eureka curled up asleep on the seat of the buggy
indeed I would much rather be your story teller under these conditions than to be the President
you will let me be like a brother will you not for all our lives for dear Lucy s sake
his face was almost completely hidden by a long shaggy mane of hair and a wild tangled beard but you could make out his eyes glinting like black beetles under all the hair
if he can produce but seven then this is not the piglet that was lost but another one
then the sled lurched ahead in what appeared a rapid succession of jerks though it never really came to a dead stop again half an inch an inch two inches
Thank you he was about to go back upstairs when Uncle Vernon actually spoke
we must arouse Esmeralda first replied Clayton
Oh well done cried Professor Flitwick clapping
then he took another pencil but this time he had a definite object in view
walking back from the library on his own one afternoon he heard somebody whimpering from a classroom up ahead
he was so angry he could hardly speak
Blimey said the other twin
he couldn t ever remember feeling happier
as he passed through the opening the front sight of the rifle caught upon the edge of the inswung door with sufficient force to close it tightly after the fleeing ape
the Snitch
but my child do not despair this knowledge come to him just too late
just then a man came running into the hall and addressed the Prince after making a low bow
as Thornton got to his feet Buck seized his mittened hand between his jaws pressing in with his teeth and releasing slowly half reluctantly
the insidious revolt led by Buck had destroyed the solidarity of the team
they had won
she was sorry that she had ever seen the forest God
Ron s were a bit short for him you could see his sneakers underneath them
we ve got to close in on it Harry called not taking his eyes off the key with the damaged wing
I do not understand Lucy s fading away as she is doing
said she my friend I reward you for your swiftness by proclaiming you Prince of horses whether of Wood or of flesh and hereafter all other horses in the land of Oz at least must be considered imitations and you the real Champion of your race
I could not but smile at which he grimaced
I could detect the strain in the Professor s patient voice
and I must trouble you with an old man s wheezing waffle before we sink our teeth into our delicious feast
but you ruled it wisely and well for many years said she and made the people proud of your Magical Art
no and I m not anxious to begin said Eureka
while she spoke Robert Canler had alternately flushed and paled and when she ceased speaking he arose and with a cynical smile upon his strong face said you surprise me Jane
Hermione ignored him
he tried to turn his head but even with the effort his eyes seemed to grow glassy again so I gently put it back
then there are things which so afflict him that he has no power as the garlic that we know of and as for things sacred as this symbol my crucifix that was amongst us even now when we resolve to them he is nothing but in their presence he take his place far off and silent with respect
Harry and Ron barely had time to exchange mystified looks before she was dashing back an enormous old book in her arms
the attendant knew the symptoms and at once summoned aid

Tarzan of the Apes what think you
Clayton stood rigid with raised spear
what are we to do
was Ozma once a boy
at length he fell into a quiet slumber nor did he awake again until afternoon
now he d done it
suddenly he jumped to his feet with his eyes blazing and all the signs of intense cerebral excitement
I m not going to drop a pin said Zeb
her head was high in ever alert attention her long tail moved slowly in sinuous and graceful undulations
the people of the house are careful to lock the door every night so I feared that Lucy must have gone out as she was
what was going on
he said this is dreadful
Nah first stop fer us is Gringotts
believe me yet a little friend John
take this stuff upstairs now the Dursleys house had four bedrooms one for Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia one for visitors usually Uncle Vernon s sister Marge one where Dudley slept and one where Dudley kept all the toys and things that wouldn t fit into his first bedroom
the _Czarina Catherine_ made a phenomenally quick journey so much so that captain Donelson s suspicions were aroused but his superstition united with his canniness played the Count s game for him and he ran with his favouring wind through fogs and all till he brought up blindfold at Galatz
how sad
I m going to Dawson Thornton stood between him and Buck and evinced no intention of getting out of the way
nor did he neglect the sterner duties of life while following the bent of his inclination toward the solving of the mystery of his library
they did not seem to know anything these newcomers
as he answered me his face grew stern and he said in quite a different tone Oh it was the grim irony of it all this so lovely lady garlanded with flowers that looked so fair as life till one by one we wondered if she were truly dead she laid in that so fine marble house in that lonely churchyard where rest so many of her kin laid there with the mother who loved her and whom she loved and that sacred bell going toll

I thought you were stuffed
Dr Vincent took the bandage from its throat and showed us the punctures
as they swung on the turn the sled went over spilling half its load through the loose lashings

Arthur bent and kissed her and then we sent him and Quincey out of the tomb the Professor and I sawed the top off the stake leaving the point of it in the body

the Russian Consul too acting for the charter party took formal possession of the ship and paid all harbour dues etc
Oh said the Professor then you are nearer the beginning both of you than friend John here who has to go a long way back before he can even get so far as to begin
men were shaking hands it did not matter with whom and bubbling over in a general incoherent babel
they must show that Voldemort s coming back
but he became nervous again when the next visitor was announced
at times we could not see an arm s length before us but at others as the hollow sounding wind swept by us it seemed to clear the air space around us so that we could see afar off
I have been entertaining a theory concerning those skeletons for the past two months and I want you to answer my question to the best of your knowledge were the three skeletons you buried all human skeletons
and then he remembered the look on Tarzan s face when they had discovered that the cabin was empty such a look as the hunter sees in the eyes of the wounded deer he has wantonly brought down
a thin mist began to creep up from the river and it grew and grew till soon a dense fog enveloped the ship and all around her
Francois guiding the sled at the gee pole sometimes exchanged places with him but not often
all the time I had been breathlessly watching Jonathan I had with the tail of my eye seen him pressing desperately forward and had seen the knives of the gypsies flash as he won a way through them and they cut at him
she did not see Clayton again that day
I suppose he saw something in my face which checked him for he suddenly stopped and said with a sort of manly fervour that I could have loved him for if I had been free Lucy you are an honest hearted girl I know
Bless me
you do not understand dear replied Clayton
he felt so ashamed of himself that he went to Wood and offered to resign from the Quidditch team
but now good wanderers your luncheon is on the table so please sit down and eat as much as you like
he d never had such a bad day in his life
you have your mother s eyes
just before I was leaving the old lady came up to my room and said in a very hysterical way must you go
some days they did not make ten miles
he bent down over the fireplace they couldn t see what he was doing but when he drew back a second later there was a roaring fire there
asked Zeb rather bewildered by the suddenness of it
my God my God
then he turned to me and said here there is one thing which is different from all recorded here is some dual life that is not as the common
he held up a little silver whistle as he remarked that old place may be full of rats and if so I ve got an antidote on call
Lord Voldemort showed me how wrong I was

his muscles became hard as iron and he grew callous to all ordinary pain
what he wants payin fer deliverin the paper
I hate them Gringotts carts he did still look a bit sick so Harry entered Madam Malkin s shop alone feeling nervous
maybe it was because they hadn t seen what Harry had seen in the forest or because they didn t have scars burning on their foreheads but Ron and Hermione didn t seem as worried about the Stone as Harry
a Sawhorse is a thing they saw boards on remarked Jim with a sniff
d Arnot coughed
I found out something about him he told Hagrid
he then explained to me that it was commonly believed that on a certain night of the year last night in fact when all evil spirits are supposed to have unchecked sway a blue flame is seen over any place where treasure has been concealed
I shall not of course lie well Voldemort said that he only killed my mother because she tried to stop him from killing me
now Madam Mina you are in any case _quite_ safe here until the sunset and before then we shall return if we shall return
there is not even a toilet glass on my table and I had to get the little shaving glass from my bag before I could either shave or brush my hair
the Champion had killed eleven bears in his time returned the unseen man and we know this is true because when any creature is dead the invisible charm of the dama fruit ceases to be active and the slain one can be plainly seen by all eyes
but he was indeed a hero in the eyes of these men men accustomed to hunting big game
it must be Quincey and John
what do you make of it Professor Porter
he nudged one of his companions and they all laughed
if anything cuts me he replied the blood runs out to show where I am cut
once they came near to the enclosed garden of the clinging vines and walking high into the air looked down upon it with much interest
papa was presumed to entertain some wondrous theory of an unthinkably ancient civilization the remains of which lay buried somewhere in the Congo valley

like some huge phantom Kala swung noiselessly from tree to tree now running nimbly along a great branch now swinging through space at the end of another only to grasp that of a farther tree in her rapid progress toward the scene of the tragedy her knowledge of jungle life told her was being enacted a short distance before her
Tarzan let the first two pass beneath him but as the third came swiftly on the quiet noose dropped about the black throat
then the mountains seemed to come nearer to us on each side and to frown down upon us we were entering on the Borgo pass
without saying any more he took his seat and the Professor began to resume his statement we must trace each of these boxes and when we are ready we must either capture or kill this monster in his lair or we must so to speak sterilise the earth so that no more he can seek safety in it
the terror in her sweet eyes the repulsion the horror told a story to my heart that was all of hope
the old dog did not like it and showed plainly that he was afraid of Buck
as they jostled their way through a crowd of confused Hufflepuffs Harry suddenly grabbed Ron s arm
when d Arnot told me what it was and what it meant to you I returned to the jungle and recovered it
because I get it back from the worthless wretch who stole it from the woman who robbed the dead and the living
regarding our plans we finally decided that Mina s guess was correct and that if any waterway was chosen for the Count s escape back to his castle the Sereth and then the Bistritza at its junction would be the one
there are five of us when those absent ones return
I know it so well as if a great hand of fire wrote it on the wall
what is it asked Percy
we ve come ter take some money outta Mr Harry Potter s safe you have his key sir got it here somewhere said Hagrid and he started emptying his pockets onto the counter scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits over the goblins book of numbers
out of the way you he said punching Harry in the ribs
just one said Hermione
of this I am sure the sun rises to day on no more miserable house in all the great round of its daily course
this poor soul is nearly as cold as that beside her
everyone fell over laughing except Hermione who leapt up and performed the countercurse
a carnivorous animal living on a straight meat diet he was in full flower at the high tide of his life overspilling with vigor and virility
the bestial faces daubed with color the huge mouths and flabby hanging lips the yellow teeth sharp filed the rolling demon eyes the shining naked bodies the cruel spears
I write all these things in the diary since my darling must not hear them now but if it may be that she can see them again they shall be ready
but be careful of him for safety s sake
I have sent messengers to summon all of Dorothy s old friends to meet her and give her welcome and they ought to arrive very soon now
and he knew that he would find them by the great post in the center of Mbonga village
_Mina Harker s Journal _ _30 September _ when we met in Dr Seward s study two hours after dinner which had been at six o clock we unconsciously formed a sort of board or committee
yeh are if yeh want ter stay at Hogwarts said Hagrid fiercely
the Professor sat in silence for a few minutes and the darkness hid the grim smile that wreathed his wrinkled countenance
Harry looked over her shoulder to read it danger lies before you while safety lies behind two of us will help you whichever you would find one among us seven will let you move ahead another will transport the drinker back instead two among our number hold only nettle wine three of us are killers waiting hidden in line
who cared what the three headed dog was guarding
I remember you very well
in another moment he was at the cabin and after a short time had again thrown the latch and entered
we all instinctively drew back
beats me how yeh even know abou Fluffy Oh come on Hagrid you might not want to tell us but you do know you know everything that goes on round here said Hermione in a warm flattering voice
some change had come over her body
instead he drew a leathern case from his pocket and took from it several sharp knives which he joined together one after another until they made a long sword
Jc Jc Jc Harry left the locker room alone some time later to take his Nimbus two thousand back to the broomshed
he d done it he d shown Snape
it was an hour before the Apes could again bring themselves to approach the cabin to continue their investigations and when they finally did so they found to their chagrin that the door was closed and so securely fastened that they could not force it
he stared at the back of the card
I never jest
as he turned the little mean faced man drew a revolver from his belt and shot the giant in the back
his twin called after him to hurry up and he must have done so because a second later he had gone but how had he done it
the gleaming eyes were fixed upon her in intent ferocity
can you talk
heads down yelled Hagrid as the first boats reached the cliff they all bent their heads and the little boats carried them through a curtain of ivy that hid a wide opening in the cliff face
no you Miss many pleasures remarked the cab horse pityingly
he must have come off by himself for none notice him
at the moment he seemed as sane as any one I ever saw
what would you do
it would require three more to return to the treasure and then with that enormous weight which required you say four sailors to carry it would be months before we had again reached this spot
now listen to me all three of yeh yer meddlin in things that don concern yeh

Harry learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a Quidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a world cup match in 1473 that Seekers were usually the smallest and fastest players and that most serious Quidditch accidents seemed to happen to them that although people rarely died playing Quidditch referees had been known to vanish and turn up months later in the Sahara desert

Jonathan Harker
this was a very interesting experience to them and Dorothy said I wonder why it is that we can walk so easily in the air
I m glad we didn t have to fight that one Harry whispered as they stepped carefully over one of its massive legs

so Tarzan scolds them both and threatens Gunto with a taste of the death bearing slivers if he abuses Tana further and Tana for her part is compelled to promise better attention to her wifely duties
_4 August _ still fog which the sunrise cannot pierce
she asked
he bent down picked up the door and fitted it easily back into its frame
did you hear about Gringotts
with one great leap Harry managed to grab the key slam the door and lock it
he would thrust his nose into the cool Wood moss or into the black soil where long grasses grew and snort with joy at the fat earth smells or he would crouch for hours as if in concealment behind fungus covered trunks of fallen trees wide eyed and wide eared to all that moved and sounded about him
but the hunger madness made them terrifying irresistible
Wizard sport
Quincey and I talked it over but the more we talked the more puzzled we got till now I can say for myself that I m about up a tree as to any meaning about anything
to morrow in the morning early you call for me and we come together to see our pretty Miss so much more strong for my spell which I have work
tell me all about it
how horrid of you Eureka
in the center was a large Emerald green star and all over the four quarters were sewn spangles that glittered beautifully in the sunshine
Canler gasping for breath nodded
how much had he heard
this battle is but begun and in the end we shall win so sure as that God sits on high to watch over his children
we are my Lord your lordship s humble servants Mitchell Sons Candy
of course there are said Ron
that is why I must go
bin watchin from me hut said Hagrid patting a large pair of binoculars around his neck but it isn t the same as bein in the crowd
last night there was no exodus so to night before the sundown I took away my garlic and other things
of course how else could I see it

mind I don t say that they never was but I do say that they wasn t in my time
he has certain qualities very largely developed selfishness secrecy and purpose
Dorothy was too dazed to say much but she watched one of Jim s big ears turn to violet and the other to rose and wondered that his tail should be yellow and his body striped with blue and orange like the stripes of a zebra
I will do my best to be a brave primeval woman a fit mate for the primeval man
Dudley began to cry loudly
with a sob he laid his head on my shoulder and cried like a wearied child whilst he shook with emotion

Dr Seward is loved not only by his household and his friends but even by his patients who being some of them hardly in mental equilibrium are apt to distort causes and effects
in a few minutes Mary opened the door and announced Dr Van Helsing
as we left the house in my fly which was waiting Van Helsing said to night I can sleep in peace and sleep I want two nights of travel much reading in the day between and much anxiety on the day to follow and a night to sit up without to wink
why Eureka said Dorothy reproachfully what a cruel question
I want you to give me permission to read all Miss Lucy s papers and letters
he had a ard cold look and red eyes and I took a sort of mislike to him for it seemed as if it was im as they was hirritated at

there was an ugly flesh wound but no signs of a fracture of the skull
at first the piglet stuck in the neck of the vase and I thought I should get him after all but he wriggled himself through and fell down into the deep bottom part and I suppose he s there yet

but if you remain visible the bears will see you and devour you said a girlish young voice that belonged to one of the children
welcome said Hagrid to Diagon Alley he grinned at Harry s amazement

I tried to pacify her and at last succeeded and she lay quiet but I could hear her poor dear heart still beating terribly

thirty six he said looking up at his mother and father
Dudley s favorite punching bag was Harry but he couldn t often catch him
was Clayton s reply
several things favored him in this
Yes was the reply
in case he should find it out too soon we should thus be still ahead of him in our work of destruction and his presence in his purely material shape and at his weakest might give us some new clue
behind us he closed the door and locked it
there were only twenty nine left out of the fifty
it was the difference to him between life and death

it was all very silly he knew but therefore the more outrage to his dignity and his anger waxed and waxed
they simply seemed to fade into the rays of the moonlight and pass out through the window for I could see outside the dim shadowy forms for a moment before they entirely faded away
wish I d had three Wizard brothers five said Ron
it makes me ireful to think o them
suppose the stairs get steeper
stop moving Hermione ordered them
simply that there is some cause in common

Seekers are always the ones who get clobbered by the other team thanks Seamus said Harry watching Seamus pile ketchup on his sausages
he examined and admired the tattooing on the forehead and breast
there would still be life in it but death then would be the only charity it craved
the Professor knows something of a great many languages so we shall get on all right
the language of the Apes had so few words that they could talk but little of what they had seen in the cabin having no words to accurately describe either the strange people or their belongings and so long before Tarzan was old enough to understand the subject had been forgotten by the tribe
by what right sir did you interfere between my daughter and Mr Canler
they were carried along a dark tunnel which seemed to be taking them right underneath the castle until they reached a kind of Underground harbor where they clambered out onto rocks and pebbles
then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching
gone gone never to return to us
not alive
I m most starved to death
asked Dorothy gazing fearfully at the great scaley head the yawning mouth and the big eyes
it is very annoying for I do not see how I am to shave unless in my watch case or the bottom of the shaving pot which is Fortunately of metal

she lay quite still and I looked round the room to see that all was as it should be
funny way to get to a wizards school the train
I could see easily for we did not leave the room in darkness she had placed a warning hand over my mouth and now she whispered in my ear hush
she greeted us warmly and said you will be glad to know that Lucy is better
three days passed by which time Buck and his mates found how really tired and weak they were
on on they came until Kerchak himself slunk stealthily to the very door and peered within
every part brain and body nerve tissue and fibre was keyed to the most exquisite pitch and between all the parts there was a perfect equilibrium or adjustment
there was no expression of either fear or surprise upon his tranquil face yet he must have been both astonished and afraid for after his eyes had rested upon the ungainly form of the horse for a moment he walked rapidly to the furthest edge of the roof his head turned back over his shoulder to gaze at the strange animal
there are books and things there which I want
raising their rifles they fired into the underbrush in the direction from which the missiles had come
what a fine fellow is Quincey
Harry recognized him at once from the card he d gotten out of the Chocolate frog on the train

it was the way he had learned
Hams and pheasants were hanging from the ceiling a copper kettle was boiling on the open fire and in the corner stood a massive bed with a patchwork quilt over it
at length he recollected the whole hideous scene at the stake and finally recalled the strange white figure in whose arms he had sunk into oblivion
his only apparent ambition like Dave s was to be left alone though as Buck was afterward to learn each of them possessed one other and even more vital ambition
they all wore short wooden wings which were fastened to their wooden bodies by means of wooden hinges with wooden screws and with these wings they flew swiftly and noiselessly here and there their legs being of little use to them
well well
see there was this Wizard who went bad
for fifty yards before her the trail was straight and down this leafy tunnel she saw the stealthy advancing figure of a strange and fearful creature
Oh you cannot go away of course so you must be destroyed was the answer
when Terkoz saw Tarzan approaching without his arrows he continued to belabor the poor woman in a studied effort to affront his hated chieftain
his father s this had been his father s

I took their names and addresses in case they might be needed
take this he handed Harry a small club a bit like a short baseball bat
I tried it harder and found that it was not really locked but that the resistance came from the fact that the hinges had fallen somewhat and the heavy door rested on the floor

here s his head all cut and full of broken glass
a grip of the hand the tightening of an arm over the shoulder a sob in unison are expressions of sympathy dear to a man s heart
the boy laughed cheerfully and jumped out
how strange

now give me the Stone unless you want her to have died in vain never Harry sprang toward the flame door but Voldemort screamed seize him and the next second Harry felt Quirrell s hand close on his wrist

good evening my dear Professor cried the man extending a cordial hand
didn t you feel the ground shake
and now bedtime
it is all over said Van Helsing
I can see be quiet Ginny and it s rude to point Mrs Weasley smiled down at them
but we dropped into this adventure rather unexpectedly
now here let me say frankly lest you should think it strange that I have sought the services of one so far off from London instead of some one resident there that my motive was that no local interest might be served save my wish only and as one of London residence might perhaps have some purpose of himself or friend to serve I went thus afield to seek my agent whose labours should be only to my interest

he was stooping to kiss her when Van Helsing motioned him back
at another time Spitz went through dragging the whole team after him up to Buck who strained backward with all his strength his fore paws on the slippery edge and the ice quivering and snapping all around

Dr Van Helsing you love Mina I know
_25 September _ I cannot help feeling terribly excited as the time draws near for the visit of Dr Van Helsing for somehow I expect that it will throw some light upon Jonathan s sad experience and as he attended poor dear Lucy in her last illness he can tell me all about her

the ape was staggered and what with the mortal wound in his side had almost collapsed when with one mighty effort he rallied for an instant just long enough to enable him to wrest his arm free from Tarzan s grasp and close in a terrific clinch with his wiry opponent
it felt as though he was sitting on some sort of plant
for a moment or two we stood appalled all save Lord Godalming who was seemingly prepared for such an emergency
I must keep writing at every chance for I dare not stop to think
his Aunt rapped on the door again
for the first time she realized the depths of the man s love all that he had accomplished in so short a time solely for love of her

and remained silent
at last he said the forest hides many secrets a movement in the trees behind Ronan made Hagrid raise his bow again but it was only a second centaur black haired and bodied and wilder looking than Ronan

I know that you were with her at Whitby

he became quite quiet and went and sat on the edge of his bed resignedly and looked into space with lack lustre eyes
but Jane did not once lose consciousness
it was to the death
in Tarzan s clever little mind many thoughts revolved and back of these was his divine power of reason
watching his chance he darted away and the chase was resumed
I looked around for his birds and not seeing them asked him where they were
more tormentors Buck decided for they were evil looking creatures ragged and unkempt and he stormed and raged at them through the bars
he keeps feeding them with his flies and the number of the latter is becoming sensibly diminished although he has used half his food in attracting more flies from outside to his room

chasing an errant swarm of bees is nothing to following a naked lunatic when the fit of escaping is upon him
black Michael s as good as new agin an E s not the bully to stand fer it not E an mark my word for it sir

their feet fell heavily on the trail jarring their bodies and doubling the fatigue of a day s travel
in this book Dorothy had to take her kitten with her instead of her dog but in the next Oz book if I am permitted to write one I intend to tell a good deal about Toto s further history
for she is not a grinning devil now not any more a foul thing for all eternity
for the sailors and especially Snipes he had developed a great hatred
it took a dozen attempts on the part of the thoroughly frightened blacks to reenter their village past the horrible grinning face of their dead fellow and when they found the food and arrows gone they knew what they had only too well feared that Mirando had seen the evil spirit of the jungle
Tarzan was perplexed

she was in such evident distress that I tried to comfort her but without effect

they heard him banging things with his Smelting stick all the way down the hall
not a Wizard eh
now you must all be going soon
this time we had all had a good sleep for the grey of the coming dawn was making the windows into sharp oblongs and the gas flame was like a speck rather than a disc of light
Mr Dursley however had a perfectly normal owl free morning
Van Helsing asked if he had heard voices or a voice and he said he could not say that at first it had seemed to him as if there were two but as there was no one in the room it could have been only one
if only the hat had mentioned a house for people who felt a bit queasy that would have been the one for him
there you know now why I love him so
I answer for Mina and myself he said
to day he came back and almost bounded into the room at about half past five o clock and thrust last night s Westminster Gazette into my hand
he was a soldier of France and he would teach these beasts how an officer and a gentleman died

it told me in its very tones the anguish of your heart
the attendant thought it would be more useful to watch where he should go than to follow him as he might lose sight of him whilst getting out of the building by the door

when I came back from the window Lucy had lain down again and was sleeping peacefully
then none of them looking at each other they all said thanks and hurried off to get plates
last night she slept well all night and did not disturb me once
maybe Peeves let it in for a Halloween joke they passed different groups of people hurrying in different directions
he seemed to have been prepared for every obstacle which might be placed by accident in the way of his intentions being carried out
to kill was the law of the wild world he knew
I suppose it is a part of the horrible curse that such is when his touch is on his victim

do you not understand why it was killed
then as he is criminal he is selfish and as his intellect is small and his action is based on selfishness he confines himself to one purpose
at least so he says but I don t give much for it myself for if he did E never said a word about it to his missis when E got ome and it was only after the escape of the wolf was made known and we had been up all night a huntin of the Park for Bersicker that he remembered seein anything
he had only one outburst and that was yesterday at an unusual time
by the next morning Ron s bitten hand had swollen to twice its usual size
Hagrid grunted
the hairy man could spring up into the trees and travel ahead as fast as on the ground swinging by the arms from limb to limb sometimes a dozen feet apart letting go and catching never falling never missing his grip
he laughed at that and his laugh was merry and frank
Francois sat down and scratched his head
however there was business to be done and I could allow nothing to interfere with it
in vain Buck strove to sink his teeth in the neck of the big white dog
cheer up friends
Trevor cried Neville blissfully holding out his hands

they snapped me wand in half an everything
the whole realm was his
the third time that he thrust out the weapon there was a loud roar and a fall and suddenly at his feet appeared the form of a great red bear which was nearly as big as the horse and much stronger and fiercer

but the glass he kept saying where did the glass go the zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong sweet tea while he apologized over and over again
no no my friend Jonathan you go take the lock off a hundred empty house in this your London or of any city in the world and if you do it as such things are rightly done and at the time such things are rightly done no one will interfere
they wore white uniforms with real diamond buttons and played what is Oz without Ozma very sweetly

the next he knew he was dimly aware that his tongue was hurting and that he was being jolted along in some kind of a conveyance
in fact nothing no matter how remotely eatable had escaped them
I went to the door
there was only one room inside
once off his feet and under that mass of huskies there was no hope for him
where did you come from
he will never be a great ape he argued
it is not always so with young ladies

I only hope it wasn t poison
Hi old fossil cried the man who had first called on him for assistance did je think we wanted of you to read the bloomin notis to yourself
Dudley s mouth fell open in horror but Harry s heart gave a leap
he did not like the change in its former bright and gleaming surface but it was still a formidable weapon and one which he meant to use to advantage whenever the opportunity presented itself
asked d Arnot
for an instant he listened intently and then from the jungle came the agonized scream of a woman and Tarzan of the Apes dropping his first love letter upon the ground shot like a panther into the forest
the other Apes derived unlimited amusement from Tublat s discomfiture for broken nose was a disagreeable old fellow whom no one liked anyway
if I went out with a couple of rifles and a gun bearer and twenty or thirty Beaters to hunt a lion I should not feel that the lion had much chance and so the pleasure of the hunt would be lessened in proportion to the increased safety which I felt

but my dear fellow we have now been three weeks upon the march
suddenly I felt a hand on my shoulder and heard the Count s voice saying to me good morning
they are all converging he said
comb your hair he barked by way of a morning greeting
she seems not too well herself and doubtless she fears to worry me
Van Helsing s sternness was somewhat relieved by a look of perplexity
immediately she turned and left the hut and as she passed through the doorway Tarzan saw that she carried a cooking pot in her hand
for me
the dark circle became a dot on the moon flooded snow as Spitz disappeared from view
we are travelling fast and as we have no driver with us to carry tales we go ahead of scandal but I daresay that fear of the evil eye will follow hard behind us all the way
and then he was gone again into the swaying trees following the high flung spoor which no other human eye could have detected much less translated
Z because the other initials were P I n H E a d and that spelled pinhead which was a reflection on my intelligence
I have a motive of which be sure she would have approved
and dear sir even if he did he would not know what to do
but this is nonsense
I think she heard you so said Ron but he looked a bit uncomfortable
his clothing fitted his form snugly and was gorgeously colored in brilliant shades of green which varied as the sunbeams touched them but was not wholly influenced by the solar rays
from Spitzbergen through the Arctic and across Canada and the Barrens he had held his own with all manner of dogs and achieved to mastery over them
Oh Jonathan you will I know forgive me if I do wrong but it is for your own dear sake
he lies on the sofa hardly seeming to breathe and his whole body appears in collapse
this couldn t be true it couldn t
Oh you know Quirrell already do you
he asked
the driver went about his work and he called to Buck when he was ready to put him in his old place in front of Dave
they made their way through the trees in silence for so long that Harry thought Firenze didn t want to talk to him anymore

the little man pointed inland so that the giant was forced to turn away from the others to look in the direction indicated
all the studying he had to do kept his mind off his misery
his brain and his heart are all right this I swear before I have even seen him so be at rest
cold damp air rushed past him as he fell down down down and FLUMP
suddenly he called out look
John Clayton Lord Greystoke did not ask to be transferred to the British man of war

soon he saw many people clambering over the sides of the larger vessel and dropping into the boats
an idea struck me and I looked up
no one must injure one of our friends in our presence growled the lion and Zeb ran to Jim and whispered that unless he controlled his temper in the future he would probably be torn to pieces
Malfoy s eagle owl was always bringing him packages of sweets from home which he opened gloatingly at the Slytherin table
it seemed to have in it a whole history of the country
even the little bugs of the black book were familiar friends though their arrangement meant nothing to him but these bugs were new and unheard of
the Sunland was very dim and distant and such memories had no power over him
I ought to be a fairy grumbled Jim as he slowly drew the buggy home for to be just an ordinary horse in a fairy country is to be of no account whatever

he took off the hat and walked shakily toward the Gryffindor table
when he came out of the room again I told him of Arthur s question and he replied I am not surprised
you have told me all about Lucy and so now we shall not speak of it lest it distress

I can feel that my strength and energy are coming back to me
yesterday and it would not have been too late

she doesn t know her mind a bit she seems to see the storm coming but can t decide whether to run up north in the open or to put in here
at night camp was made
at night great beasts snarled and roared about their tiny cabin but so accustomed may one become to oft repeated noises that soon they paid little attention to them sleeping soundly the whole night through
afterward the Gump was taken apart and I was put back on this wall but I can still talk when I feel in the mood which is not often
9d amount of overplus as shown in receipted account herewith
I cried
I had hoped Er I had thought or Er how very happy we should be that he was not caught in the fire he ended lamely
nor did the other s frank clear eyes waver beneath d Arnot s fixed gaze
I cried Lucy dear as Jonathan and the old man clasped hands
so that s where you know who Yes said Harry but I can t remember it nothing said Ron eagerly

Ah Mr
the men stopped at our gate to ask the Porter their way as they were strangers

when I had her carefully wrapped up I put my shoes on her feet and then began very gently to wake her

why cried Dorothy in amazement it s Oz
me too said Quincey Morris laconically
give us a look Lee go on the boy lifted the lid of a box in his arms and the people around him shrieked and yelled as something inside poked out a long hairy leg

just then the deep roar of a lion sounded from the distant jungle as though to challenge whoever dared enter the lists with him
in an instant Esmeralda Professor Porter and Mr Philander had joined the two men
hot sweet breath against his cheek and mouth had fanned a new flame to life within his breast and perfect lips had clung to his in burning kisses that had seared a deep brand into his soul a brand which marked a new Tarzan

little did John Clayton imagine when he fashioned that crude but mighty portal that one day twenty years later it would shield a fair American girl then unborn from the teeth and talons of a man eater
asked the girl

believe me it is no idle curiosity
Harker was the only one who had any result and we are in great hopes that his clue may be an important one
her eye then lit on Van Helsing and on me too and gladdened
he scrambled to his feet and rushed toward her
neither stones nor people
one only he saw a sleek gray fellow flattened against a gray dead limb so that he seemed a part of it a woody excrescence upon the Wood itself
I was glad to see her paleness and her illness for my mind was full of the fresh horror of that ruddy vampire sleep
it was stifling hot inside
then the murderer was alone with her helpless victim the fat piglet and I see her pounce upon the innocent creature and eat it up are you still seeing with your mind s eye
he exclaimed and then he insisted on the Wizard taking the box of flutters and the little girl accepting the box of rustles
a hundred yards ahead the path turned and sloped steeply into the main street
Chapter XIII his own kind the following morning Tarzan lame and sore from the wounds of his battle with Terkoz set out toward the west and the seacoast
what is that way which we must not may not take

at the same moment Dr Van Helsing and I rose behind the rock and pointed our weapons at them
you must not Tarzan
stop Esmeralda stop it this minute
what s the matter in a low whisper Harry told them what he d seen
I regret that they did not visit us before sailing said Professor Porter
then she put before her face her poor crushed hands which bore on their whiteness the red mark of the Count s terrible grip and from behind them came a low desolate wail which made the terrible scream seem only the quick expression of an endless grief
Harry picked it up and felt it
my dearest Mina I must say you tax me _very_ unfairly with being a bad correspondent
you know I think the ends of Scabbers whiskers are a bit lighter said Harry trying to take Ron s mind off houses
they were in a corridor
what shall I do
now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off them but the more they strained against it the tighter and faster the plant wound around them
then Van Helsing turned and said gravely so gravely that I could not help feeling that he was in some way inspired and was stating things outside himself it may be that you may have to bear that mark till God himself see fit as he most surely shall on the judgment day to redress all wrongs of the earth and of his children that he has placed thereon
however I set it all right and he is going on well
Besides I have nothing to tell you
I had gained a new painful experience the Count could it was evident handle the earth boxes himself
shooting stars all over Britain
quite sure my Prince
Oh no
his moods change so rapidly that I find it difficult to keep touch of them and as they always mean something more than his own well being they form a more than interesting study
but he circled just beyond the range of the club snarling with bitterness and rage and while he circled he watched the club so as to dodge it if thrown by Francois for he was become wise in the way of clubs

he took with him a bag in which were many instruments and drugs the ghastly paraphernalia of our beneficial trade as he once called in one of his lectures the equipment of a Professor of the healing craft
and then Mina I felt a sort of duty to tell him that there was some one
Van Helsing came and laid his hand on Arthur s shoulder and said to him and now Arthur my friend dear lad am I not forgiven
can you tell us sir or ma am said the Wizard addressing the air because he did not quite know where the unseen people stood if there is any way we can get out of your beautiful valley and on top of the earth again
that was an awful big quake replied Zeb with a white face
nearly seven feet stood Kerchak on his short legs

I hope too Dr Van Helsing will not blame me I have had so much trouble and anxiety of late that I feel I cannot bear more just at present
no answered the owner of the big yellow eyes which were blinking at them so steadily you are wrong about that
so I told him I would simply write an account of our visit just as if I were doing a descriptive special article for _The daily Telegraph_

anyone interested in playing for their house teams should contact Madam Hooch
if we had known we were coming we might have brought along several other useful things responded the Wizard
they implored me to let them and when I said it was Dr Van Helsing s wish that either he or I should sit up they asked me quite piteously to intercede with the foreign gentleman
well they re not completely stupid
and what do you mean you re my second well a second s there to take over if you die said Ron casually getting started at last on his cold pie

he is making straight for me and I can see by the way he lifts his hat that he wants to talk
at last I pulled open a heavy door which stood ajar and found myself in an old ruined chapel which had evidently been used as a graveyard
Van Helsing said solemnly you are always right but this is life and death
I dare not think further for so I should in my thoughts dishonour a noble woman

I did not quite like it and thought it better not to keep her mind on the subject so we drifted on to other subjects and Lucy was like her old self again
he was catching flies and eating them and was keeping note of his capture by making nail marks on the edge of the door between the ridges of padding
Buck was inexorable
